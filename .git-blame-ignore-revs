# git-blame supports ignoring commits which is useful for formatting changes
# and other non-functional changes.
#
# as of writing, this file is not picked up by default by git-blame. use
# `--ignore-revs-file` or add the file to your git configuration
# `git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs`.
